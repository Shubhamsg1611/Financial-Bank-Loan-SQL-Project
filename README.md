### Conclusion:

**1. Income-Based Loan Trends:**
- Borrowers with higher annual incomes tend to take out larger loan amounts on average (High Income group has the highest avg_loan_amount).
- Borrowers in the middle income category often represent a balance between loan amount and frequency, making them a significant segment for financial institutions.

**2. Loan Distribution:**
- The total number of loans (total_loans) often decreases with income, as lower-income groups may apply for smaller, more frequent loans or may have limited access to larger credit facilities.

**3. Insights for Financial Strategies:**
- The High Income group may require tailored premium loan products with larger credit limits and competitive rates.
- The Middle Income group represents an opportunity for scaling products like mid-range personal loans, as they are a substantial part of the borrower base.
- The Low Income group might benefit from financial inclusion initiatives, such as microloans or low-interest credit schemes.

**4. Target Market Identification:**
  Financial institutions can prioritize segments based on their goals:
- Focus on revenue: Target the high-income group with premium loan products.
- Focus on volume: Engage the middle-income group, as they may offer a balance between loan size and frequency.
- Focus on social impact: Offer accessible loan products for the low-income segment.

### Summary:
This analysis helps financial institutions or businesses make informed decisions regarding product offerings, marketing strategies, and customer segmentation based on income groups.
